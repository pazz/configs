* Arithmetical Hierarchy

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetical_hierarchy

a hierarchy of highly undecidable problems.

It consists of inductively defined classes,
$\Sigma^0_n$
$\Pi^0_n$
$\Delta^0_n = \Sigma^1_n \cap \Pi^1_n$
Of languages logically equivalent to
existential ($\Sigma^0_n$) and universal ($\Pi^0_n$)
first order praenex NF formulae with $i$ quantifier alternations.

The difference to the [[Polynomial Hierarchy]] is that
here we quantify over naturals, not boolean values.
