I use different setups for my two accounts and call
>mutt -F .muttrc.gmail
to log into gmail

LDAP: 
  I use mutt_ldap_query for UoE EDDIR public ldap dir.

Gmail:
 sudo pip install goobook for google contacts. 
 This needs ~/.netrc to work.

GPG:
  works out of the box, I set my ui preferences in ~/.mutt/rc/gpg
  and individually set pgp_sign_as per config
